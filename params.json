{"name":"svgLoader.js","tagline":"A simple JavaScript file to create a properly centered loader image. ","body":"# AJAX loading spinners should be easy\r\nGenerally, however its more work than its worth often if you're using GIFs, you have to wait for the images to load and you can't use alpha transparency. Animated PNGs are a bust so you're left with using JavaScript. There are many good canvas scripts our there but this one uses SVG. Neither SVG nor canvas are supported in IE8 but you have many options to work around. \r\n\r\nThis library creates a loader similar to what you find in Android ICS devices, two counter rotating arced gradients. With this library, you can create the loader of any size and color you wish and it will be vertically and horizontally centered in the element in which you place it. Ideally the loading container should contain nothing else, otherwise you may need to add some css of the form:\r\n\r\n```CSS\r\n#Loader svg{\r\n  position:absolute;\r\n  top: 0px;\r\n  left: 0px;\r\n  z-index: 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use the loader like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id='Example1'></div>\r\n<script>\r\n    svgLoader(\r\n        document.getElementById('Example1'),    //Container for loader\r\n        100,                                    //height of spinner in px\r\n        100,                                    //width of spinner in px\r\n        100,                                    //number of sections to divide the arcs into\r\n        360,                                    //the number of degrees the arc will cover\r\n        70,                                     //the inner radius of the arc\r\n        90,                                     //the outer radius of the arc\r\n        '#000000',                              //the color of the arc\r\n        0.5,                                    //the opacity of the leading section \r\n        '4s',                                   //the time it takes for the clock-wise arc to complete a circle\r\n        '2s'                                    //the time it takes for the counterclock-wise arc to complete a circle\r\n    );\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAdam van den Hoven (@littlefyr) is responsible for this mess.
